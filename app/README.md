### Docs and Tutorials

We are on the way of creating a documentation, but it's not available right now. But we have auto-complete and TS support if you have enabled Git integration in your Wix website then you'll see integrated examples and docs with auto-completes.

Check out our YouTube Channel for tutorials.

### About Steam OAuth Process

Steam is not providing any actual oauth flow, there isn't any official API to handle auth process with Steam, instead you have openid which plays a role as another 3rd party provider to handle authentication with Steam. But main problem with that is passing state with this option is not possible. Which means a big security issue when you are dealing with auth process.

You'll have two functions, first is `redirectURL` second is `authUser` which is also possible with other providers but! issue here is as we said you can't pass a state and you won't get any token as response what you'll get is the Steam user id (a public info of any steam user) and you'll make a call to Steam web API to get the public data of user like profile photo nickname etc.

You'll need to find a way to verify logins/users like what we do with states.
