# Easy Auth by ExWeiv Apps

This library enables you to integrate some popular OAuth options with your Wix website or with your Wix Blocks application. This package is not for basic users and designed for customization, so developers can take the skelaton and work with it to integrate the OAuth providers however they want or need.

### Docs and Tutorials

We are on the way of creating a documentation, but it's not available right now. But we have auto-complete and TS support if you have enabled Git integration in your Wix website then you'll see integrated examples and docs with auto-completes.
